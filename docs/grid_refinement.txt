  "DOUBLE-THE-GRID" REFINEMENT
-----------------------------------------------------------


  The current version of the code can adjust the grid to fit broader
  spectrum, when a collapse becomes localized.  The adjustment is
  implemented as follows.

  At every time step, the spectrum of |psi_k|^2 is averaged over the
  angle and compared to the threshold value at two |k|, k_up and k_dn.
  If |psi_k_up|^2 exceed the threshold, the number of modes is doubled
  in each direction; if |psi_k_dn|^2 is below threshold, the number of
  modes is halved.  The redistribution of the modes among the
  processes are shown in the hand-written sketch,
  "grid_refinement.pdf".  When the grid is refined or derefined, the
  time step is adjusted to obey the same CFL condition.

  The grid adjustment can be used with constant forcing term in the
  equation.  However the forcing of selected modes require a constant
  grid.

  Code parameters:

      Ngrids       # number of grids (Ngrids=1 means no refinement)
      grid         # grid to start (coarsest = 0),  grid < Ngrids
      N0           # size of coarsest grid is N0xN0
      Lx           # domain size in x-direction, in physical units
      Ly           # Ly = Lx
      dealiasZ     # dealiasing starts at kmax = dealiasZ * N/2
      dealiasF     # size of the smoothing filter, in points
      regridZup    # k_up =  regridZup * N/2; regridZup < dealiasZ
      regridZdn    # k_dn =  regridZdn * N/2; regridZdn < regridZup/2
      regridTh     # refinement threshold on |psi_k|^2
