  NLIWAVES  - NONLINEAR WAVES 
  RANDOMIZING AND RESIZING RESTART FILES
-----------------------------------------------------------

  Go to you git directory (the directory where you downloaded the original code) and update it
     
     >> git pull origin master

  You will need the following files from "post_m" directory in your working directory

     myrand48_seed.m
     read_psi.m
     rerand_psi.m     
     resize_psi.m

  In a typical restart the following files are used without modifications: 

     *.psi.????          field data (binary)
     *.seed.????         random seed (binary) to recreate the same sequence of random numbers
     *.tag               current restart number and number of timesteps (text) 
     *.in                simulation parameters (text)

  The seed reproduces the same sequence of random numbers only with the same number of tasks.
  To create a new sequence, "myrand48_seed.m" can be used.  Scripts "rerand_psi.m" and
  "resize_psi.m" moduify the field data.  All *.m scripts can be run on login nodes,
  from octave's command line, after loading "octave" module.

  TESTS FOR RANDOMIZATION AND RESIZING
-----------------------------------------------------------

Let's use simulation "a1" for this.


1a.  Take a look at the interface of "rerand_psi.m"

% 
%   rerand_psi(fname_in, fname_out, N, seed, randomness)
%
%   Input:
%
%       fname_in:   binary input file (size N)
%       fname_out:  binary output file (size N)
%       N:          number of gridpoints in each direction
%       seed:       master seed (integer)
%       randomness: [0,1)
%

  
1b. Create new field data with randomness 0.01, 0.1, 1 and master seeds 1, 2, 3, 4.
    Do not modify *.seed.???? or *.tag files.
    Do not change the number of tasks.

1c. Run 12 new simulaions plus 1 original for the same time.
    Plot time dependencies for comparison.


2a.  Take a look at interface of "myrand48_seed.m"

%
%  myrand48_seed(fname, np, seed)
%
%  Input:
%       fname:  file name to create, in format "*.seed.????"
%       np:     number of processes to run on
%       seed:   master seed (integer)
%

2b.  Create new random sequences with master seeds 1, 2, 3, 4.
   Do not modify field data or *.tag files.
   Do not change the number of tasks.


2c. Run 4 new simulations plus 1 original for the same time.
    Plot time dependencies for comparison.


3a. Take a look at interface of "resize_psi.m"

function resize_psi(fname_in, fname_out, N1, N2)
% 
%   resize_psi(fname_in, fname_out, N1, N2)
%
%   Input:
%
%       fname_in:   binary input file (size N1)
%       fname_out:  binary output file (size N2)
%       N1, N2:     number of gridpoints in each direction
%

3b.  Create new field data with N2=256, N2=384, and N2=512.
     Assume starting from t=0 and file=0.

     Create "*.tag" files containing
     
     0  0  0  # nio n0 grid 

     Create new seed sequences "*.seed.0000" with master seed=0.

     Adjust time step in "*.in" files.
 
3c. Run 3 new simulations for the same time.
    Plot time dependencies for comparison.
