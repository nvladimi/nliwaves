  OUTPUT FILES
-----------------------------------------------------------


  FREQUENCY OF OUTPUT

  The code output different data at different rates.  The frequencies
  of the output is specified by the following parameters in *.in file

     dnInfo     # step intervals when to save basic info
     dnDiag     # diagnostics is done every so many info intervals
     dnData     # binary data is saved every so many info intervals

  "Info" intervals are specified in the units of timesteps at the 
  coarsest grid.  At these intervals
  the code appends one line in "*.dat" file, writing integral
  quantities computed at this particular instance.

  "Diag" and "data" intervals are specified in the units of "info"
  intervals.  At "diag" intervals, more elaborated diagnostics, such
  as computing spectra and PDFs, is performed.  The instant quantities
  are added to a storage in the memory.  At "data" interval, these
  quantities are averaged over instances and written to files, and the
  storage is emptied.  In addition, the field data, psi(x,y), is saved
  at the "data" intervals.  The field files and the diagnostics files
  are consecutively numbered: 0000, 0001, 0002,...  The headers of
  diagnostics files show the number of instances, "count", which was
  used in averaging.  The simulation time of the outputs is printed to
  the file "*.out".

  Example: suppose timestep dt=1/16, and simulation is run from t=0
  until tmax=100.  The following lines in the input file

     dnInfo  16
     dnDiag  10
     dnData  50

  would result in 

     integral quantities computed every 16 steps, or 1 time unit;
     diagnostics taken every 10 time units;
     data is saved every 50 time units.

  The *.dat line would have 101 data lines.  There would be three sets
  of field and diagnostic files: 0000, 0001, and 0002.  Diagnostics
  0001 and 0002 would be computed over 5 instances (count=5).
  Diagnostics 0000 corresponds to initial conditions (count=1), as
  well as field data 0000, and the first line in *.dat file.

  OUTPUT FILE *.out

  This is the text file with basic run information and run time
  messages.  The file contains:

     echoed simulation parameters, 
     some initialization messages for debugging,
     record of outputs (maps file number to simulation time),
     some (?) info from collapse database,
     errors and warnings.
   
-----------------------------------------------------------


  OUTPUT FILE *.dat

  This is the text file with the most basic diagnostics.  The columns
  of the file correspond to:

     1.time            simulation time
     2.|psi|_max       maximum |psi| in the domain
     3.|psi|_avg       |psi| averaged over the domain
     4.N               total number of particles (number of waves) 
     5.E_kin           total kinetic energy
     6.(-focus)*E_pot  (+/-) total potential energy 
     7.condensate      <Re(psi)>^2 + <Im(psi)>^2
     8.vortices        fraction of domain with 
                       |psi(x,y)| < vortexTh * avg(|psi|)

-----------------------------------------------------------


  OUTPUT FILES *.pdf.*

  These are text files containing the probability density functions
  |psi|, Re(psi), and Im(psi), computed over the whole domain.  PDFs
  are averaged over several instances (count) and recorded at the same
  time as restart files.  The frequency of computing PDFs are
  specified by "dnDiag" parameter in the input file, the number of
  bins - by "pdfNbins" parameter, and the psi interval - by "pdfMax".
  I recommend to use the number of bins which is large and is a
  product of different multipliers, for example pdfNbins=1200.  Such
  PDFs can easily be coarsened later.

  The columns in the files correspond to:

      1.bin           bin number
      2.psi           |psi| at the center of the bin       
      3.pdf(abs)      PDF of |psi|, normalized to 1
      4.pdf(Re)       PDF of Re(psi), normalized to 1
      5.pdf(Im)       PDF of Im(psi), normalized to 1

-----------------------------------------------------------


  OUTPUT FILES *.spc.*

  These are text files containing the spectrum of field |psi|^2.  The
  spectrum is normalized to satisfy Parseval's theorem:  the total
  number of particles (waves) in the domain is

              N = L^2 sum |psi_k|^2.
                       k

  The spectrum is averaged over angle in k-space and over several
  instances (count).  The spectrum files are recorded at the same time
  as restart files.  The frequency of computing spectrum is specified
  by "dnDiag" parameter in the input file.

  The columns in the files correspond to:

      1.k             mode number, from 0 to Nx/4
      2.|psi|^2_k     |psi|^2 averaged in interval [k-0.5, k+0.5) 

-----------------------------------------------------------


  OUTPUT FILES *.psi.*

  These are binary file with field data psi(x,y) in the format: Re,Im,
  Re,Im, Re,Im, etc.  The frequency of the output is specified by
  "dnData" parameter in the input file.

-----------------------------------------------------------


  OUTPUT FILE *.clps

  This file contains the history of individual collapses in text
  format, described in "collapse_diagnostics.txt".  To turn off
  collapse diagnostics, in the input file use

       clpsCmax   -1  # max number of active collapses
