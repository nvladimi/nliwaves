  CYCLOPS - 1D CODE WITH RADIAL SYMMETRY
-----------------------------------------------------------

  This code models isolated radially symmetric collapses in the radial
  coordinates.  It solves the focusing NLS equation

       i dPsi/dt + (1-i*a*eps)*del^2(Psi) +     

            + (1+i*c*eps*|Psi|^s)*|Psi|^2*Psi = i*b*eps*Psi

  using Adams-Bashforth time integration of 3rd order.  The spatial
  derivatives are computed either spectrally or by 4th order finite
  differences.  The code uses the periodic boundary conditions in
  [-L,L] domain. The initial conditions are Gaussian for Re(Psi) and
  zero for Im(Psi).  The width, r0, and the height, h0, of the initial
  Gaussian are input parameters, as well the coefficients in the
  a,b,c,s, and eps in the equation.

  If derivatives are computed spectrally, the code is stable at CFL =
  0.04, and dx=1/160 is enough to resolve collapses up to |psi|_max =
  50.  For finite difference scheme, the stable CFL = 0.08, and
  dx=1/320 is needed to resolve the same collapse.  Computation time
  is comparable.
  

  Compiling
-----------

  To compile the code, either link in fftw3 library:

     gcc -O3 cyclops.c -I/usr/local/fftw/fftw-3.2.2/include
             -L/usr/local/fftw/fftw-3.2.2/lib -lfftw3 -lm

  or turn off FFT support:      

      gcc -O3 cyclops.c -DNOFFT -lm                             


  Running
---------

  The parameters are given to the code as a command line options.  If
  no options given, the code runs with the default settings.  In any
  case, the parameters being used for the run are echoed to the
  screen.  Below is the example of screen output.

      >> ~/bin/cyclops_nofft 

      Code compiled without FFT support. 
      Spectral derivatives are not available. 

      started with parameters:

      /Users/nata/bin/cyclops_nofft -f cyl
         -a 1.000000 -b 0.000000 -c 1.000000 -s 0.000000 -eps 0.010000
         -r0 1.000000 -h0 3.200000 -tend 10.000000 -L 12.800000 -N 1024
         -spectral 0 -cfl 0.040000 -nout1 160 -nout2 1600

      for derived parameters see header in "cyl.clps"


  Parameters:

       a, b, c, s, eps    parameters of the equation
       r0, h0             width and height of initial Gaussian
       tend               final time (see note below)
       L, N               domain size and number of points
       spectral           compute derivatives spectrally (1) or not (0)    
       cfl                dt = CFL (dx)^2
       nout1              frequency of writing psi(0), in timesteps
       nout2              frequency of writing psi(r), in timesteps


  Note: the code terminates when collapse decays to the half of its
  time maximum, or when time reaches "tend", whichever comes first.


  OUTPUT FILE *.clps
--------------------

   Text data in a same format which is used for 2D runs (for
   compatibility of post-processing).  See "collapse_diagnostics.txt".
   The data is preceded by the header with the run parameters.



  OUTPUT FILES *.rad.*
----------------------

  Text file showing Psi as a function of radius.  The columns in the
  file correspond to:

   1.r
   2.abs(Psi) 
   3.Re(Psi) 
   4.Im(Psi) 


  COMPARING TO 2D RESULTS
-------------------------

  The symmeric 2D simulations can be compared to the results of the
  radial code using "dataray" utility.  It reads in a 2D binary file
  (Re,Im) and writes out the text file with the ray of data starting
  form point i0,j0.  The ray extends to the right until the end of
  domain.  The domain is assumed to be square, NxN points, with size
  L.  The format of the output file is the same as files *.rad.*
  described above.


  compiling:

               gcc dataray.c -o dataray.x

  usage:
               dataray.x infile outfile N i0 j0 L

  where i0,j0=0,..,N-1.  (Run without arguments for reminder.)


  When creating 2D data, make sure that the collapse maximim is
  located exactly at i0,j0.
