  COLLAPSE DIAGNOSTICS
-----------------------------------------------------------

  In the turbulence problem diagnostics of individual collapses has to
  be done in the code (as opposed to post-processing) because strong
  collapses develop extremely fast and have to be monitored
  essentially every time step.

  To do it we maintain the database of "active" collapses.  We
  introduce a threshold in collapse amplitude, above which a local
  maximum is considered as a collapse. The collapses are entered into
  database, and monitored with a rate proportional to 1/h^2, where h
  is the height of the collapse.

  New collapses are added to database at every "info" step (see
  "output_files.txt" for more detail).  Also, at every "info" step
  finished and lost collapses are removed from database.  Collapse is
  considered finished, if its amplitude drops to the half of its time
  maximum or below the threshold.  When collapse is removed from
  database, its history is saved into a file.

  For each collapse, the position of the local maximum of |psi| is
  recorded in the history, and the following quantities interpolated
  at the location of the maximum: amplitude |psi|, phase, and their
  second derivatives in the radial direction.  The computational
  procedure consists of three steps: (i) finding a local maximum of
  |psi| on the grid; (ii) finding the off-grid location by finding the
  best, in the least squares sense, paraboloid passing through
  neighboring points; and (iii) interpolating computed on the grid
  quantities to the off-grid location using bicubic interpolation.


  Control parameters in the input file
------------------------------------------

  dnInfo     # frequency (in timesteps) of saving basic info, 
             # to rescanning for new collapses, 
             # and saving histories of non-active collapses

  clpsNmax   # max length of the history of each collapse

  clpsCmax   # max number of active collapses per process
             # negative clpsCmax turns off collapse diagnostics

  clpsPsi0   # the threshold, local maxima in |psi| above 
             # the threshold are considered collapses 

  clpsRate   # parameter controlling the frequency of collapse
             # monitoring,
             #              dt_update = 1/(clpsRate * h^2)


  OUTPUT FILE *.clps
--------------------

  Text file containing the history of collapses.  The collapses are
  separated by two blank lines for gnuplot and the string of "NaN"s
  for matlab/octave.  Each collapse is preceded with one-line summary
  in the form

  %output= 12:   h_max( 0.2656 )= 41.467   h_end( 0.2718 )= 13.884
 
  In the summary line, the numeric entries correspond to:

     collapse number (consecutive since restart)
     simulation time when collapse reaches maximum (t_max)
     |psi| at t_max
     simulation time when collapse is removed from the database (t_end)
     |psi| at t_end


  The columns in the files correspond to:
  
  1.t          simulation time
  2.|psi|      amplitude at the center 
  3.|psi|_rr   second derivative of |psi| in radial direction at the center
  4.phase_rr   second derivative of phase in radial direction at the center  
  5.phase      phase at the center
